# 🛡️ Project Aegis: RASP for LLM Applications

**Project Aegis** is a Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP) system designed for LLM-powered applications.  
It protects against **prompt injection, data exfiltration, and jailbreak attacks** in real time.

## 🚀 Features (Planned for MVP)
- 🔒 **Sanitizer** – Automatically rewrite malicious prompts into safe ones.
